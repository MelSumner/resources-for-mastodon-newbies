## Things that may surprise you about Mastodon

### You can't do full-text search

Only hashtags are searchable. This is to prevent potential harassment.

### You can have multiple accounts on multiple instances

You're not locked in to one instance; many people maintain multiple "alts." It's a good idea to link to your alts in your account profiles so that people know to follow you on both.

### Not all favs (likes), boosts (retweets), and replies are necessarily shown

Favs/boosts/replies are only shown if they come from someone who is is either:

1. a member of your instance, or
2. a remote user followed by at least one person in your instance.

You can click the date to open the toot in a new tab and see the full list of favs/boosts/replies. Any URL (e.g. to a toot) can be pasted into the Search box and then you can reply/fav/boost it.

### If you mention a user in a DM, they see that DM

DMs work by being private to everyone @-mentioned in the message. To avoid a potentially embarrassing situation, be sure to use "at-username" or something similar when you want to talk privately about someone else.

### Content Warnings can hide text

Content Warnings (CWs) are good for trigger warnings, sensitive topics, topics that may not be of general interest, and hiding the punchline to a joke.

When you reply to a toot with a CW, the "CW" button is automatically selected, so if you want to reply without the same CW you will need to de-select it.

### You can post publicly to the timeline or unlisted

This is a subtle distinction, but what most people do is post to the public timeline when they think their post is of general interest (or when an instance is small enough that the local timeline is pretty quiet), and then "unlisted" is used when they think the post may only be interesting to their followers. In either case, the toot is public.
